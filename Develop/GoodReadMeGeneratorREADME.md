# GoodReadMeGenerator

  ## Description

  I created this readme generator as a way to simplify the README creation process for the every day coder. Creating and formatting a Readme file can take a ton of time away from computer Engineers, this readme should cut that time down significantly. This project helped me better understand what makes a goodreadme file and how I can better format them. In the end any generator should be intuitive and this one should be extremely intuitive even for someone new to computer engineering.
